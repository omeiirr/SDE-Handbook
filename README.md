# SDE Handbook

This is a collection of my notes while learning about software development.

## Running on localhost
```bash
git clone https://github.com/omeiirr/SDE-Handbook.git
npm i docsify-cli -g
cd docs
docsify serve
```

Open localhost:3000 in your browser and you should see a page with topics in the sidebar, which can be used as an index
